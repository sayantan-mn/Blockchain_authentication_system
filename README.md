A simple authentication program using blockchain to store the user details hash in a smart contract and authenticate using user account from metamask and credentials.

# 🔐 Blockchain Authentication Application

A decentralized authentication system that uses **Blockchain**, **Smart Contracts (Solidity)**, and a **React** front-end to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof identity verification. This project aims to eliminate the vulnerabilities of traditional username-password systems by leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional authentication systems rely on centralized servers, which are prone to data breaches, phishing, and insider threats. This application introduces a **blockchain-based user authentication system** where user credentials and identity verification are managed through **smart contracts**, enhancing trust, decentralization, and security.

### ✅ Key Features

- 🔐 **User Registration & Login** via blockchain
- 🧾 **Data stored on-chain** using smart contracts
- 👁️ **Immutable and Transparent** authentication logic
- ⚙️ Built with **Solidity**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Web3.js**
- 📄 Simple front-end UI for sign-up and login
- 🌐 Web3 integration with MetaMask
